DECISION MAKING POINTS

-FIFO QUEUE FOR PENDING MESSAGES

-Server will be receiving a first string from the client indicating the command/operation/service, that can be REGISTER, UNREGISTER, CONNECT, DISCONNECT or SEND. For optimization, the maximum length of a a command string is of 10 (number of characters in the largest possible command, which is UNREGISTER or DISCONNECT) +1 character for the ASCII '\0'. So this will be stores in a char array of 11 bytes.

-A username can contain at most 15 characters, including numbers and letters.  <<PROBLEM WITH THE PROTOCOL, WHAT HAPPENS IF OTHER SERVER CONSIDERS A SIZE OF 20 FOR THE USERNAME?>> ===> As it is not specified in the guidelines and it may be something that interferes with the protocol, it is consideres to have a username of 256 characters

-Is the shell that has the role to classify the output value of the functions (register, etc.) and print the message according to it? Or should be the function itself <<IT MAKES MORE SENSE FOR THE FUNCTION ITSELF TO CHECK AND PRINT THE RESULT, BUT THEN WHAT ARE THE RC.OK, RC.ERROR AND RC.USER_ERROR RETURN VALUES FOR???>>

-CAN WE USE 0 AND 1 TO REPRESENT "OFF" AND "ON" FOR THE STATUS OF THE USER?

-UNSIGNED SHORT (uint16_t) TO REPRESENT THE PORT NUMBER?

-DO WE SEND A STRING OR A BYTE FROM SERVER TO CLIENT?? ((IMPORTANT: All fields sent will be encoded as strings. Remember that the
strings end with the ASCII ’\0’ code))

-HOW DO WE GET THE IP AND PORT FROM A CLIENT??

-CHECK FOR -1 EVERYTIME WE DO AN OPERATION WITH A SOCKET??

-RETURNING 0 OR '0' FROM THE SERVER IS DIFFERENT. WHAT IS THE PROTOCOL ==> SHOULD BE CHAR 0, NOT CHAR '0', BECAUSE THE BIT REPRESENTATION IS DIFFERENT

-CREATE THREADS ONCE WE KNOW THE TYPE OF OPERATION? OR CREATE THREAD ONCE THE CONNECTION IS ACCEPTED AND CHECK THE OPERATION IN EVERY THREAD??

-DO WE REALLY NEED A CONDITION VARIABLE TO ACCESS THE LIST? IT SHOULD SUFFICE WITH A MUTEX

-MAXIMUM NUMBER OF USERS?? MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PENDING MESSAGES??

-IN WHICH CASES ARE WE SENDING THE CODE 2 (ERROR) TO THE CLIENT??

-POR QUE PUEDO HACER:
char name[2];
strcpy(name, "FRANCISCOJAVIERGARCIABLAS");

Y NO DAR NINGUN ERROR??
